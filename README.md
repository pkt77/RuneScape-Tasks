# RuneScape-Tasks
Task list for RuneScape daily, weekly, and monthly things to do. 

https://pkt77.github.io/RuneScape-Tasks/

Taks list contains mostly D&Ds, but also personal objectives like daily shop runs.
It is in sync with the in-game (UTC) time so the checklist resets at the same time the game does.

Red is for combat, blue is for XP, green is for money.
